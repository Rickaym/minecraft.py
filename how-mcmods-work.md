# Clearing up the air.

**To clear up some things! This project strictly entails of [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition) and the subdivision of releases for it.**

There are other Minecraft versions such as;

- **[Minecraft Bedrock Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-windows100)** :: written in C++ and only available on Windows Machines.
- **[Minecraft Pocket Edition](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe&hl=en&gl=US)** :: written in C++ as well taht supports iOS and Android. Whilst a port of Pocket Edition was released for Windows Phone 8.1 back in 2014 as well. I is good.

## Minecraft Java Edition

Minecraft Java Edition quite surprisingly enough is written in **[Java By Oracle](https://www.java.com/)**. Since it's classic release back in 2009 there has been a decade of updates over a few dozens of versions **([see here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_version_history))**. This edition allows for cross-platform play between Windows, Linux and macOS -- but as far as compatibility goes, there are no OS dependent issues.

To be considerably useful, it would be best to innovate something that suffices for most versions if not all -- but to start from `1.8.9`.

## Java

Perhaps this will explain why it's required for a typical installation of Minecraft Java Edition to have a version of **Java** in the past.

**Minecraft Java Edition RUNSS On Java**

- Although, note that with the new updates; Minecraft is packaged with it's own Java to run on.

Fortunately, this isn't a bootcamp course on Java so I'll be skiing through the details like a crocodile to an Australian man.

This compiler translates Java programs into Java Bytecode which is a machine language for the imaginary Java Virtual Machine. Java Bytecode programs are then executed by an interpreter.
