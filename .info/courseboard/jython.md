Jython or JPython is a Java implementation of Python (the default Python implementation is CPython or Python) currently supports Version 2.7.2 (comparatively to CPython's 2.7.2 â€” [here](https://github.com/jython/jython))

#### Can it actually support it?

For Jython to be compatible with CurseForge we require a decent support, out-of-the-box or not, in fundamental Java concepts like [annotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_annotation), [generics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java#:~:text=Generics%20are%20a%20facility%20of,compile%2Dtime%20type%20safety%22.) and a few other things.

> Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms are written in terms of types to-be-specified-later that are then instantiated when needed for specific types provided as parameters.

You will find the `Java <=> Jython` integration examples in the examples folder <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/Rickaym/minecraft.py/tree/main/examples/java-jython-integration)</sup>.
