# [minecraft.py](https://github.com/Rickaym/minecraft.py)

Brief; Utilizing the JVM implementation of Python Jython to create a Python language adapter that interacts with popular Modding API [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods) to allow Python scripting possible in Minecraft modding. **Check the master branch**

## Informant

- **[*01/07/2021*]** First of July 2021 Marks the initiation date of this project.<br>
  This project is in an early (like TOO early) state of development. The latest tag for the Forge Service Interface Provide is inserted for reference.

### Clearing up the air.

**To clear up some things! This project strictly entails of [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition) and the subdivision of releases for it.**

Assume when you see _"Minecraft Mods"_ to be of Java Edition unless defined explicitly.
There are other Minecraft versions I don't intend to support as yet such as;

- **[Minecraft Bedrock Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-windows100)** :: written in C++ and only available on Windows Machines.
- **[Minecraft Pocket Edition](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe&hl=en&gl=US)** :: written in C++ and supports iOS and Android. Whilst a port of Pocket Edition was released for Windows Phone 8.1 back in 2014 as well.

### Scoreboard

Checklist to determine the possibility of a Jython IModLanguageLoader for forge.

| Prerequisite     | Jython Integration | Current Status |

## Contribution

If you want to collaborate on this project, go ahead and read documents from [`informant`](https://github.com/Rickaym/minecraft.py/tree/master/informant) to understand the fundamental concepts (they aren't complete nor fully backed-up) just yet.

Also contact me at `Neo#1844` through discord or join **[this](https://discord.gg/UmnzdPgn6g)**. Would be phenomenal if you have knowledge regarding the ins and outs of Java or MCForge Scripting! :P
