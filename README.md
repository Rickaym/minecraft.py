  <br>
  This project is in an early (like very early) state of development. Sadly, no decisions, pathways or plans have been made to guarantee the objective plausible as of yet..

### Clearing up the air.

**To clear up some things! This project strictly entails of [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition) and the subdivision of releases for it.**

There are other Minecraft versions we don't intend to support as of yet such as;

- **[Minecraft Bedrock Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-windows100)** :: written in C++ and only available on Windows Machines.
- **[Minecraft Pocket Edition](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe&hl=en&gl=US)** :: written in C++ and supports iOS and Android. Whilst a port of Pocket Edition was released for Windows Phone 8.1 back in 2014 as well.

## Contribution

If you want to collaborate on this project, go ahead and read documents from [`informant`](https://github.com/Rickaym/pyminecraft/tree/main/icons) to understand the fundamental concepts.

Also contact me at `Neo#1844` through discord. Would be phenomenal if you know the ins and outs of Java, Python and MCForge Scripting! :P
