# [minecraft.py](https://github.com/Rickaym/minecraft.py)

Brief; Utilizing the JVM implementation of [Python](https://www.python.org/) [Jython](https://www.jython.org/) to implement a Python language adapter for the ForgeSPI that is available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods). A working implementation will allow Python scripting possible in Minecraft modding with minute overhead.

## Informant

- **[*01/07/2021*]** First of July 2021 Marks the initiation date of this project.<br>
  This project is in an early (like TOO early) state of development.
- This repository will contain the **on-going** attempts of implementing the concept.

### Clearing up the air.

**To clear up some things! This project strictly entails of [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition) and the subdivision of releases for it.**

Assume when you see _"Minecraft Mods"_ to be of Java Edition unless defined explicitly.
There are other Minecraft versions I don't intend to embrace as yet such as;

- **[Minecraft Bedrock Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-windows100)** :: written in C++ and only available on Windows Machines.
- **[Minecraft Pocket Edition](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe&hl=en&gl=US)** :: written in C++ and supports iOS and Android. Whilst a port of Pocket Edition was released for Windows Phone 8.1 back in 2014 as well.

### Checlist

General determination for the possibility of a Jython mod loader for forge.

| Prerequisite     | Jython Integration | Current Status |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Java Annotations | 〰️                 | in progress    |
| Java Generics    | 〰️                 | in progress    |
| Java Objects     | ✔️                 | known possible |

If you want to contribute on this project, go ahead and read documents from [`informant`](https://github.com/Rickaym/pyminecraft/tree/main/.info) to understand the concepts.

Also contact me at `Neo#1844` through discord or join **[this](https://discord.gg/UmnzdPgn6g)**. Would be phenomenal if you have knowledge regarding the ins and outs of Java or MCForge Scripting! :P
