  This project is in an early (like very early) state of development. Sadly, no decisions, pathways or plans have been made to guarantee the objective plausible as of yet..

### Contribution

If you want to collaborate on this project, go ahead and read the ideas board and understand the fundamental concepts. Also contact me at `Neo#1844` through discord. Would be phenomenal if you know the ins and outs of Java, Python and MCForge Scripting! :P
