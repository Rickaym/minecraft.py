Who is minecraft.py?
----------------------
Clearing up the air.

This project strictly entails of `Minecraft Java Edition <https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition>`_ and the subdivision of releases under it's name.

Assume when you see *"Minecraft Mods"* to be a reference to Java Edition unless defined explicitly.
There are other Minecraft versions I don't intend to embrace as yet such as;

- `Minecraft Bedrock Edition <https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-windows100>`_ :: written in C++ and only available on Windows Machines.
- `Minecraft Pocket Edition <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe&hl=en&gl=US>`_ :: written in C++ and supports iOS and Android. Whilst a port of Pocket Edition was released for Windows Phone 8.1 back in 2014 as well.
