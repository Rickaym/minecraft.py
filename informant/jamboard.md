This is not intended for understanding the project.

## [Scala Language Adapter (Scorge)](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/Scorge)

**Info~**

1. `src/main/scala/net/minecraftforge/scorge/lang...`
2. `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/"net.minecraftforge.forgespi.language.IModLanguageProvider"`

## [Kotlin Language Adapter (KotlinForForge)](https://github.com/thedarkcolour/KotlinForForge)

**Info~**

1. `src/main/kotlin/thedarkcolour/kotlinforforge...`
2. `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/"net.minecraftforge.forgespi.language.IModLanguageProvider"`

## Progression

Make new package preferrably under the name of the language adapter being made inside<br> `src/main/package` **>>** `src/main/jython/net/minecraftforge/minecraft.py/...`.

Establish a new folder called `resources` that define metadata in `META-INF` with a copy of `"net.minecraftforge.forgespi.language.IModLanguageProvider"` inside a folder called `services` (intentions are unclear) with the path pointing to the code of the adapter language provider on the classpath.

Define the version and metadata of the language adapter in `main/resources/pack.mcmeta`.

<details open>
<summary>
Example of the metapack is as follows by KotlinForForge.<br><br>
</summary>

```mcmeta
{
  "pack": {
    "description": "Kotlin for Forge resources",
    "pack_format": 4
  }
}
```

Here we see examples of the IModLanguageProvider that lives inside the services folder to be loaded.

```java
// inside Scorge // net.minecraftforge.forgespi.language.IModLanguageProvider

net.minecraftforge.scorge.lang.ScorgeModLanguageProvider

// inside KotlinForForge // net.minecraftforge.forgespi.language.IModLanguageProvider
thedarkcolour.kotlinforforge.KotlinLanguageProvider
```

A closer inspection to `IModLanguageProvider` will tell you that it provides [an interface](../ForgeSPI-4.0/src/main/forgespi/language/IModLanguageProvider.java) for loading _xyz_.</summary><br>

```java
package net.minecraftforge.forgespi.language;

import java.util.function.Consumer;
import java.util.function.Supplier;

/**
 * Loaded as a ServiceLoader, from the classpath. ExtensionPoint are loaded from
 * the mods directory, with the FMLTpe META-INF of LANGPROVIDER.
 *
 * Version data is read from the manifest's implementation version.
 */
public interface IModLanguageProvider
{
    String name();

    Consumer<ModFileScanData> getFileVisitor();

    <R extends ILifecycleEvent<R>> void consumeLifecycleEvent(Supplier<R> consumeEvent);

    interface IModLanguageLoader {
        <T> T loadMod(IModInfo info, ClassLoader modClassLoader, ModFileScanData modFileScanResults);
    }
}
```

This opens up a window to extend the same public interface in Jython which is described as down below <sup>[[1]](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-in-a/0596100469/ch26.html)</sup>;

> The automatic availability of packages on Jython.syspath applies to Javaâ€™s standard libraries, third-party Java libraries you have installed, and Java classes you have coded yourself. You can extend Java with C using the Java Native Interface (JNI), and such extensions will be available to Jython code, just as if they were coded in pure Java rather than in JNI-compliant C.

A project post regarding the same idea back in 2015 in the [Minecraft Forums](https://www.minecraftforum.net/) will give you an idea of approach and understanding on this topic <sup>[[2]](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/modification-development/2532785-jython-for-modding)</sup>.
