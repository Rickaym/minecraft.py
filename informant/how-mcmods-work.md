Surprisingly enough the Minecraft Java Edition is written in **[Java By Oracle](https://www.java.com/)**. Since it's classic release back in 2009 there has been a decade rich of updates over a few dozens of versions **([see here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_version_history))**. This edition allows for cross-platform play between Windows, Linux and macOS -- but as far as compatibility goes, there are no OS dependent issues to be in notice.

To be considerably useful, it would be best to innovate something that suffices for most versions if not all.

Starting from `1.8.9`.

## Java

Perhaps this will explain why it's required for a typical installation of Minecraft Java Edition to have a version of **Java** in the past.

### **Minecraft Java Edition RUNS! On Java**

It's important to note that Minecraft as of present is packaged with it's own Java to run on. Although this does let bundled mods to run on and you will find out about this further down the document.

### JVM and hybrid complications

Fortunately, this isn't a Java bootcamp course so I'll be skiing through the details like an indonesian to ajollibee.

Java is known to be an interpreted and compiled language and what does this actually mean?

#### To conceptualize it.

1.  The compiler translates Java programs `.jar` into Java Bytecode `.class`. This is a form of machine language for the imaginary **[Java Virtual Machine](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine)**.
2.  Java Bytecode programs are then interprets / executes at runtime by **[an interpreter](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-interpreter)**.

What does this mean for Minecraft Modding?
